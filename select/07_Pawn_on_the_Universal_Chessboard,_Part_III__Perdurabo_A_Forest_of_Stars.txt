From this death infested maze of cold?
One eye open; nine days hung against nine nights.

I will endure. All father.
Freight of the universe eye please guide me.
Nine days to hang against the dark here.
Spilled glistening across the gaoled way.
The new way. Crutches raised against the face of fear.

Can you see through the fast approaching dawn?
Find a way to beat the universal chessboard you miserable pawn?
Royal blew it.
just so much detritus for nowhere.

I am not the way.
Not the truth nor the light.
Caught up in the same barbs, we are.
No chemical solutions.

Old world, same disorder.
